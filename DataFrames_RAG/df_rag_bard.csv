31,87181,In biology an exon is a coding region of a gene on a DNA or RNA molecule. Exons are the parts of a gene that are transcribed into messenger RNA mRNA and eventually translated into proteins. They contain the instructions for building proteins. DNA contains both exons and introns. Introns are non coding regions that are removed during the process of gene expression. After transcription copying DNA to mRNA introns are spliced out and the remaining exons are joined together to form a mature mRNA molecule. This mature mRNA is then used by ribosomes in the process of translation to create proteins. Here s a quick breakdown DNA Contains both exons coding and introns non coding regions. Transcription Copies the exons and introns from DNA to mRNA. Splicing Removes introns from the mRNA molecule. Translation Uses the information in the mature mRNA exons only to build proteins.
