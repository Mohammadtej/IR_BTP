0,156493,Goldfish are fascinating creatures that have the remarkable ability to grow in size according to their living conditions including the size of their tank the quality of water and their diet. Unlike many believe goldfish do not have a predetermined size limit but will grow in response to their environment. This adaptability is a survival mechanism allowing goldfish to thrive in various conditions. However this doesn t mean they should be kept in small bowls or tanks as inadequate space and poor water quality can lead to health issues and stunted growth. Proper care including a sufficiently large tank clean well filtered water and a balanced diet encourages healthy growth and longevity in goldfish allowing them to reach their full potential size.

25,183378,Exons are regions of a gene that contain the code for producing proteins. During the process of gene expression the initial RNA transcript from a gene is modified to remove non coding regions known as introns leaving only the exons. These exons are then spliced together to form a mature messenger RNA mRNA molecule which is translated into a protein. The arrangement and combination of different exons through alternative splicing can lead to the production of multiple protein variants from a single gene contributing to the complexity of protein functions within the organism.
